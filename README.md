# River-raid Project
## Project Description
This project will be a recreation of the arcade classic - River Raid. It will be made in Python 3 using framework called PyGame. 
This project will only work on Windows due to our limitations.

## Game Description
In this game player will be playing as a fighter-airplane trying to survive as long as possible in a narrow corridor and gain as many points as possibe. Player will be facing a various difficult enemies. 
### Death
An airplane will have a limited amount of fuel, which will diminish with every second. Using all of it will cause a death of a player. In order to replenish his supplies, an airplane will need to fly into a fuel canister. The other ways for player to die are: collision with a wall, or collision with an enemy.
### Scoring system
A player will gain points for every kill me makes on an enemy. The tougher the enemy, the more points a player will recieve as a reward. He will also be able to destroy fuel canisters in order to gain points, but this will prevent him from refueling.
